# Documentation Hub

This directory is the central documentation portal for the decompilation project. Use it to move from target identification and **exhaustive public-source census** through reconstruction, asset handling, manifests, and verification without losing version context or evidence.

## Active machine-readable inventories

- `../manifests/source-registry.csv` — public source roots/classes, scope, evidence role and enumeration status.
- `../manifests/narc-paths.csv` — current evidence-backed NARC/NitroFS role inventory. Unknown roles and unverified target-specific counts stay explicit rather than being inferred.

## Recommended documentation flow

1. **Enumerate the public source universe first** in `SOURCE_REGISTRY.md` / `../manifests/source-registry.csv`; a category is not complete because one useful source was found.
2. Identify the exact target or unresolved target question in `VERSIONS.md` and `REGIONAL_SURVEY_MATRIX.md`.
3. Register assumptions and research method under `PUBLIC_SOURCE_SURVEY.md` and `RESEARCH_GUIDE.md`.
4. Record internal paths/formats only at the confidence level supported by evidence; preserve source conflicts.
5. Reconstruct source, data, or assets following `PROJECT_STANDARDS.md` and `REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`.
6. For asset work, follow `ASSET_WORKFLOW.md` and register material in `../manifests/`.
7. Apply the validation levels defined in `VERIFICATION.md`.
8. Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `ROADMAP.md` when meaningful milestones are reached.

## Documentation rules

- Do not claim a source category or Generation V public-source survey is complete while registered categories remain `Enumerating`, `Candidate`, `Blocked`, or otherwise unresolved.
- Distinguish confirmed findings from hypotheses and public-reference metadata from project-verified target data.
- Identify the exact target version or revision for version-specific claims whenever evidence permits.
- Record paths, symbols, offsets, hashes, commands, sources, and conflicts when practical.
- Use `TBD`, `unknown`, or `null` instead of inventing missing information.
- Preserve enough provenance for another researcher to reproduce or challenge a finding.
- Keep retail ROM images, decrypted game images, console keys, and other redistributable game binaries out of the repository.
